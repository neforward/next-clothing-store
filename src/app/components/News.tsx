      article: `The world according to Rick Owens — punk brat of Porterville, California, turned health-goth of Paris — is at once brutal and beautiful. His clothes (like his Mad Max leather jackets and clomping megasneakers) and his stores (like the one in Paris that famously features a sculpture of the man himself urinating) have always insisted on it; it’s the world that has caught up. Now, at 57, the designer has a strong claim to be one of fashion’s éminences grises, bottle-black locks notwithstanding. But as a rare independent in an ever more corporatized fashion world, Owens is far from going gentle into that good night: After winning the Council of Fashion Designers of America’s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2017, he was named its Menswear Designer of the Year in 2019. For the Cut’s new interview series with fashion’s most formative voices, Owens spoke about aging, pleasure, and the radical power of ’70s shock rock.

      Am I catching you at a good time?
      I just got up. We went to the House of Yes in Brooklyn. Have you been there? It was really cute. It was a voguing ball.
      
      You are one of the few successful fashion designers to have remained independent all these years. You’re just about the only one.
      I don’t know how that happened — actually, I do know how that happened. I had fantastic partners who allowed me to develop my voice longer than the three seasons they usually give designers. I always joke with them that they could have done this with anybody. Being able to get stuff — I don’t mean to be crass — at the right price at the right place at the right time, that’s the trick. It’s not the concept so much, though that helps. Getting it executed is what it’s all about. It doesn’t sound that poetic, but it can be.
      
      But the cycle just goes faster and faster, and people want more and more.
      I have only four collections a year, four runways on which I’m judged. I have a very different perception of the speed than guys that work at those houses do. I don’t have it that hard at all. There is a certain amount of pressure, but what else would I be doing with my life? It keeps you on your toes. And stimulated. And it gives this brand a sense of purpose, which everybody could use.
      
      Many of your colleagues are reconsidering if runway shows are the best way to show fashion at the moment. Are you committed to them?
      Absolutely. They were the last thing I ever dreamed of when I started doing clothes. I never even considered coming out for a bow at the end of a runway show, which is the motivation for a lot of people when they start thinking of being a designer. It took me a minute to find my voice, to allow people to register me and decide that they were going to tolerate somebody that made slow movements. When I started out, the movements were a lot slower, and now the gestures are a lot grander and a lot more dramatic, but I didn’t really realize that I was going to enjoy it that much, the theater of it. The opportunity to be able to talk about things other than just clothes. That’s a gift, being able to have a platform to explore different types of beauty in a more behavioral-social way.
      
      You’ve helped change the way we see beauty.
I think it’s just a primal thing. People are always going to want ceremonies; they’re always going to gather together to experience something moving as a community. It’s Druid ceremonies, it’s church, it’s voguing balls. And there needs to be a sense of risk, that sense of competition, and that’s what runway shows can be. It’s seeing somebody take a risk and make a leap. We will forever be looking for that thrill. Especially now, with Instagram, runway shows are more relevant than ever. People can communicate about them in a more speedy way than they could before. I was going to say the right voices are going to end up being heard, but we’ve seen what happened. The loudest voices are the ones that get heard. But I don’t know if that’s going to last forever.

The loudest often wins.
What’s interesting now is that whole bourgeois thing, which Riccardo Tisci started doing at Burberry and Hedi Slimane is doing at Celine. There’s a big Celine billboard in Place de la Concorde that I pass every day. A pleated tweed culotte skirt and a Peter Pan collar trimmed in lace, pearls or something — it’s this huge billboard. I know that it’s supposed to be provocative, and it is, because it kind of stuns me every time I see it. That this sensibility is aspirational for a young audience that never really experienced that, I suppose? All of their parents are wearing my clothes! I can see how that generation is reacting against me. I take it very personally. With a giggle.

I do appreciate that there’s a subtlety to it, that it’s a reaction to the flash that we’ve been seeing for a while. I was just telling somebody that I don’t really go to shows when I come to New York, but the ones that I would have gone to, I would have gone to see the Row. They’ve really maintained a consistently pure aesthetic that I’m always going to look at. It’s the antithesis of all the other runway shows in New York. I admire what they’re doing. There’s that other brand, CDLM; I liked what I saw that they were doing. But I’m sure there are others. Those were the ones that I really took note of, but I’m sure there are others.

You’re so engaged!
Oh, sure, I’m a fashion fan. I like to see what’s happening around. I’m not a snob — well, I am a snob, I guess.
Let’s talk about Larry LeGaspi, the ’70s costume designer who worked with Kiss and Labelle. You channeled him for a 2019 collection and wrote a book about his work. Why him?
When I started that book, I knew it was going to be an autobiography explaining how my aesthetic developed — through him, in a way. When I was 13 and Kiss exploded, it was kind of unprecedented. There had been the New York Dolls and glitter rock, but this one was so bombastic and with such full-on testosterone, with the vomiting of blood and the pyrotechnics and fog and the vitality of these men in these heels and black. And then it was very much more black leather. Later on, it became black spandex. But then it was more sinister and more depraved and more menacing — authentically menacing from my perspective as a 13-year-old. That was supposed to impress, and it did.

There was a melancholy side of this too; it’s a lost generation. It expressed this utopian, idyllic, innocent world — and the thrill is that this kind of camp sensibility became part of the black soul culture in America and then became part of stadium rock, middle-American culture. This camp sensibility from a gay man [LeGaspi] became a huge influence. That’s my DNA. That gender fluidity but with a vitality. Swagger. That primal male swagger mixed with makeup and heels. And with menace. With aggression. That recipe is kind of my perception of masculinity in a way, my personal perception.

This was your primal scene.
And knowing that there was some place to go and be that — that it was a possibility. That hadn’t occurred to me. That I could be this guy spewing blood in makeup and heels doing a guitar solo. In fog. That’s who I wanted to be.

Vomiting blood?
Yes! And laying waste.

Do you think you’ve achieved that?
To a certain extent, I suppose I have! I’ve always been very honest about it all being self-invention, and if I can do it, anybody can do it. It’s all about figuring out who you are. That’s something I’ve always tried to say through clothes, too. Figuring out what’s wrong with you and letting it go and working on it but not killing yourself over it. Just working with what you’ve got. I’m very honest about it all being complete artifice, but that’s fine. That’s all it needs to be.

That sensibility in your work seemed to emerge fully formed — that dark aesthetic, the scary power of it.
I don’t know. I was a pretty fey kid, pretty fragile. It was a pretty long road; it took a long time. There’s definitely a lot of fragility there sometimes. It’s still very much a work-in-progress — as we all are.

In recent collections, your pieces have seemed as much architecture as fashion.
When I started, it was a very languid, drippy silhouette. As I learned how to execute things more precisely, it started engorging. It started getting stiffer and more sculptural. You can see this arc of somebody learning how to have some fun. At the peak of your life, I suppose in theory, the ideal scenario is you gradually reach some kind of level of serenity and self-awareness. And my serenity … My father was so interested in self-awareness and learning. As he got older, though, he just became more frustrated and more bitter and the opposite of serene. I don’t know if that’s because physically there’s a deterioration that makes you fearful and reactionary and if that’s inevitable. But I’ve also seen older people who get to a place of peace that I admire. Maybe by that time, I’ll just have grandkids and kittens.

Your wife, Michèle Lamy, is a muse and your collaborator. How does your relationship work?
Michèle is almost all id. There are times when I’m just not ready for her and I have to remind myself to open up to her in a different way. A lot of my life is just thinking logically how to get from point A to point B in the straightest line. If I’m in that kind of mood, I have to change my brain to have a conversation with Michèle. She is going to get completely abstract. She is pure poetry. Sometimes I just have to remind myself, Get out of your uptightness and listen to this, get into this mood. This mood is essential. She reminds me to not be so rigid. She pushes me around in different ways that somehow I had the good sense enough to see I needed to have to normalize me. It’s hard to quantify what influence she has, but I trust her. And somewhere deeply I know it gives me some kind of sense of balance. Otherwise, I would just get too uptight.

I’ve got to ask: How do I get the Rick Owens body?
I work out almost every day. And you do have to do sit-ups, at least 100 sit-ups a day. You just have to. It’s like brushing your teeth. It becomes something you do. It’s just vanity. It’s not that much about health. That’s what I do. What I do is all about aesthetics, so I’m going to do whatever I can to make everything around me look as good as it can. I’ve been doing this for 20 years. But I’m somebody who loves routine, so for me, repetition is therapeutic and fun. But I’m really, really lucky. I smoke a lot and I eat cake.      `,

      article: `Rick Owens is a prominent man in the fashion industry, his name is known around the world and he not only designs clothes but has also recently taken on the challenge of furniture design. So what makes him who he is and what are his thoughts on masculinity? In an interview with Vestoj, provided by Business of Fashion, he talks about how he sees himself as a cliché and how he felt he had to mold to societal expectations but art school and fashion allowed him to rebel and find himself. Check out some of the excerpts below and read the full article here.

      Who is Rick Owens?
      I’m a Los Angeles cliché. I had a conservative, controlled childhood, then became as uncontrolled as I could, then realised that I liked control after all. This is the story of my generation: kids that were too controlled and then became drug addicts and alcoholics before finding spirituality and Zen. It’s so common. I’m totally common.
      
      On childhood:
      I was pretty effeminate and sensitive as a boy. It’s that same old story: sensitive boy in a small town, trying to fit in. Growing up, there was a certain set of rules or expectations about how to behave. That angered me, and later on I felt vengeful. I tried to conform, but I never managed to do it very successfully. I was forced to bend, to act in a way that I was uncomfortable with. I had to become more masculine. I couldn’t be flamboyant; I had to butch it up. It was humiliating. In a way I suppose it helped me form a sense of defiance and rebellion and when I left to go to art school in the big city, I became as flamboyant as I possibly could.
      
      On his relationship with his parents:
      I wore platform boots and capes and full makeup. But when I went back home to Porterville to see my parents, I’d take off all the makeup and nail polish and put on normal clothes. If I wanted to have a relationship with them, I had to compromise. And in the later years, when I was completely honest with them and allowed them into my life, they had to make some compromises too. That was lovely. In a way, it was the money that made them change their minds about me. My parents figured, well as long as he’s successful he must be okay. It was kind of bittersweet because obviously it was a false context, but then life isn’t perfect.
      
      On influence:
      I’ve always wanted to participate in the world, to be involved. The world that I propose to people is not meant to impose or insist. It’s not a manifesto, it’s a proposal. It’s meant to be gentle. Although it was born out of my reaction to the rules imposed on me, I want it to be an alternative, not the only option. That’s really important to me.
      
      On artifice:
      I like artifice. The artifice I like is always exaggerated and borderline ridiculous. It’s challenging the codes of good taste and notions of conservative beauty in a good-humoured way. Humour is one of the most elegant things in the entire universe, you know.
      
      On his kicks:
      I wear sneakers of my own design. I’ve become very known for sneakers, which is ironic considering that when I first started doing them it was almost a parody. I thought sneakers were the most boring things on the planet. They represented complete banality to me. But I was going to the gym and I needed some so I started doing my own exaggerated version, and they’ve become a signature of mine. The ones I wear are on a stretch leather sock: they’re kind of a sneaker combined with an opera leather glove.
      
      On successful men’s fashion:
      The most successful men’s fashion is conservative with just a hint of rebellion. Imagine something classic, but with a ripped lining or a hidden strap that implies S&M. I do clothes like that myself. One of the inspirations for my men’s clothes is Neil Young. He’s a poet and he’s masculine but he’s sensitive too. He seems honest, with a sense of honour. I don’t think honour tops the list of women’s attributes but it’s one of the appealing things about a man. We expect men to build the house, and women to make it a home. In a very primal way we still want men to be providers and women to add grace.

      article: `For his Fall/Winter 2021 collection “GETHSEMANE,” Rick Owens held his show away from his usual Palais de Tokyo location, opting for the Tempio Votivo del Lido near his Venetian home, in large part due to the travel restrictions and lockdown laws during the pandemic. Many critics describe this collection as safe, lacking that Owensified fashion-forward element the American designer seldom fails to deliver.

      Though hardly a harsh critique, those who formed that opinion weren’t necessarily wrong. It was Owens’ intention to keep it toned down in comparison to his past collections, believing that this was not a time to show excess in fashion, with other issues more pressing, such as that of the global health emergency. 
      
      His show notes summed this up perfectly: “We’re all living a tense period in history waiting for a resolution, be it catastrophic or rational, in a suspense that feels almost Biblical in its drama.” Yet, despite it being a restrained collection, it was still strong, on-brand and left everyone with the general consensus that even when Rick Owens is ‘bad,’ it’s still very good.
      
      The hold Rick Owens has on both the fashion industry and the general public is unprecedented. Wearing Rick Owens transports you to an ulterior universe that is so detached from any other operating brand – a universe that has been carefully carved out by one man and his muses. 
      
      When describing Rick Owens’ aesthetic, words like proto-punk, “glunge” (a merge of glam and grunge), dystopian, dark, and post-apocalyptic are often thrown around. And while these words may be true visually, there is more to the essence of a Rick Owens runway creation than buzzwords.
      For his Fall/Winter 2018 “SISYPHUS” show, Owens depicted the ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus by the way of down-stuffed lumpy garments, hinting at the giant boulder that eternally needs to be carried up a hill (a tortuous theme very much present in the fashion industry and and its high-demand of constant renewal), as well as looking at unconventional seduction.

Rick Owens’ designs explore themes of the macabre, outlying a uniform that looks like it could have come from an asylum’s creative workshop. On the contrary, witnessing a Rick Owens show never leaves you gloomy, but rather in awe of the beauty that a non-traditional route to aesthetics can offer.

References to classic and Biblical literature and art are a common thread to the Rick Owens universe. This can be traced back to Owens’ formative years, as he was homeschooled by his father who taught him about art, literature and philosophy to an extent that wouldn’t be covered in a public school’s curriculum.

While deeply enriching, this education was also very limiting, with Owens’ father being strict about what kind of art was allowed to be consumed in the family home. For example, only classical music was allowed to be played in the household, though Owens quickly found an affinity for punk-rock. In a sense, the Rick Owens brand both refers to and rebels against his childhood, and more specifically, his father.

The designer’s collections feel personal without being literal. His inspirations such as the alt musical acts The Ramones or The Stooges doesn’t come in the form of a graphic band tee, but rather in intricate clothing that embodies the core values and beliefs of the source point.

On a business and operational level, this personal touch remains intact. The Rick Owens brand, unlike many of Fashion Week’s biggest brands, hasn’t been bought by a conglomerate. It operates under OWENSCORP, the company he set up with his partner Michèle Lamy in 2004 after moving to Paris.

This not only allows the designer to retain his creative control but also to do things differently to your average brand. Visually, it’s clear to see. He doesn’t rely on logos or monograms to create an it product that will sell, but instead focuses on codes such as his elongated beige drawstrings or his five-inch Kiss Boots that are instantly recognizable as part of his avant-garde realm, without necessitating the Rick Owens logo.

He also writes his own show notes, which are extensive in reference and design explanations, and are always made available to the public. He doesn’t dress anyone for his shows, yet his attendees are always wearing Rick Owens – or at least something that feels relevant to the Rick Owens vein. The personal dedication poured into this brand by the designer is clearly reflected by the dedication, loyalty and passion of its dedicated cult.

It’s one thing to be obsessed with the Rick Owens brand, but it’s another to be enthralled by Rick Owens, the man. Kiss Boots-wearing, muscle-showing, tank top-sporting, the long dark-haired designer is striking just by looks, though is nothing compared to his eloquently-spoken thoughts that reveal his raw talent and intellect.
And the designer’s world is impressive in its own right, and its loyal subjects are equally notable. We’ve got to give it to them – Rick stans are on another level. The subReddit r/RickOwens offers daily updates on the designer, new pickups, and fit checks. The Rick Owens x Converse collaborative shoe is one of the biggest memes on Internet fashion hubs (mainly showing frustration that the general public won’t recognise they are Rick Owens). There’s the Internet famous couple who met over Instagram when one approached the other to compliment them on their Rick fit. Let’s be real, if your fans call you the “Lord of Darkness,” you know you’re doing something right.

There is something so endearing about rebellious anti-beauty that is still celebrated as beautiful, a perspective that goes against the status quo. Rick Owens isn’t the first designer to do so (Martin Margiela, Vivienne Westwood, Ann Demeulemeester, the wave of Japanese fashion designers such as Rei Kawakubo and Junya Watanabe, just to name a few) and he certainly won’t be the last – but he is the current.

Of course, when it comes to fashion, taste will always be subjective. There will never be a consensus name to nominate as “best designer.” There are always certain attributes to look for in a “good” designer, such as quality of garments, consistency in brand image, and a story to tell or a message to say. Incidentally, Rick Owens hits all of those.`,
